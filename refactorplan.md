Improve Add Employees UI

user stories:

As a user, I see page with three inputs; one is labeled 'Name',
another 'Position', the last 'Salary'. under the inputs, there is a
'submit' button

The top of the page has a title - Add an Employee

under the title, we see a list of current employees

When I fill in the inputs, and I click the submit button,
the new employee appears in the list.

If I try to add an employee but have not filled in all the inputs,
I see an error message that tells me to fill in the inputs.
